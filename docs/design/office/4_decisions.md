# office — Decisions

Record non-obvious decisions here by title. Task references carry provenance; superseded decisions remain in place so their original reasoning stays legible. See [CONVENTIONS.md §3](../CONVENTIONS.md#3-what-earns-a-decision-entry) for the admission rule and required `Cost:` line.

## A domain library crate and a CLI crate

**Recorded:** 2026-09 · [ORB-13117]
**Code anchors:** `Cargo.toml` `[workspace] members`; `scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh::policy`

### Context

STD-02@1 §R7 said to start as one crate and split only for a build or
dependency need (STD-02@2 §R7 has since made two crates the default for a new
CLI, for the reason below). A single crate can express the layers as modules with grep
bans. The template, though, exists to be copied by agents into projects that
grow, and the edge that matters most — the domain must not know about
argument parsing, terminals or log subscribers — is exactly "a dependency
edge that must be enforceable", R7's own justification for a split.

### Decision

Two crates: `office-core` (library; protocol domain) and
`office` (binary; composition and surface). Cargo makes clap unreachable
from the core rather than merely banned, and the core is ready to be consumed
by a second surface (MCP server, desktop app) without restructuring. Further
crates still need an R7 reason; the default for new code is a module in one
of these two. A project that is certain to stay a single small binary may
collapse to one crate with STD-02's single-crate check.

### Consequences

- The domain/surface boundary is enforced by the compiler plus
  `check-dependency-direction.sh`, not by review.
- Cost: two manifests, a `[workspace.dependencies]` table, and a crate
  boundary that forces `pub` on the core's API where one crate would use
  `pub(crate)`.

## clap without color or terminal-width features

**Recorded:** 2026-09 · [ORB-13117]
**Code anchors:** `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies] clap`

### Context

STD-01 R17 requires the color/TTY decision in exactly one place. clap's
default `color` feature and the `wrap_help` feature each query the terminal
themselves, and a terminal-dependent help rendering would also make the help
goldens depend on where they were captured.

### Decision

clap is built with `default-features = false` and without `color` or
`wrap_help`. Help and usage errors are plain text everywhere; styling, if it
is ever wanted, is applied from the sink's decision.

### Consequences

- Help renders byte-identically on every machine, so goldens are stable.
- Cost: no colored help and no wrapping of long help lines to the terminal.
## Usage errors keep clap's rendering

**Recorded:** 2026-09 · [ORB-13117]
**Code anchors:** `crates/office/src/output/mod.rs::finish_parse_error`

### Context

STD-01@1 §R19 says a non-JSON error is a single `error: <message>` line.
clap's usage errors are an `error:` line followed by a tip or did-you-mean
suggestion, the usage line and a pointer to `--help` — the actionable detail
R21 asks for.

### Decision

Deviation from STD-01@1 §R19 for usage errors only: in human mode they keep
clap's multi-line rendering (first line `error: …`, exit 2). In JSON mode they
are one `{"error","code":"usage_error"}` object like every other error.
Command failures follow R19 exactly.

### Consequences

- Wrappers still branch on exit code 2 and the stable `code`.
- Cost: a script reading human-mode stderr gets several lines for a usage
  error and one line for a command failure.
- Update [ORB-13134]: STD-01@2 §R19 allows exactly this rendering, so it is
  no longer a deviation.
## standards-check warns locally and fails in CI

**Recorded:** 2026-09 · [ORB-13117]
**Code anchors:** `Makefile` `standards-check`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `STANDARDS_STRICT`

### Context

The adopted standards are vendored into `docs/standards/` by the
constellation's `sync-standards.sh`, which may run after the repository is
created. A fresh copy must still pass `make ci`, but a real project whose
standards were never vendored should not pass CI.

### Decision

Without `docs/standards/check.sh`, `make standards-check` prints a warning
and the command to run, and exits 0 — unless `STANDARDS_STRICT=1`, which CI
sets, and then it fails.

### Consequences

- The template and a just-created project pass `make ci` locally.
- Cost: a local `make ci` can pass while CI fails, until the standards are
  vendored.
## Missing gate tools warn locally and fail in CI

**Recorded:** 2026-09 · [ORB-13134]
**Code anchors:** `Makefile` `missing_tool`, `test`, `goldens`, `deny`, `ci-fast`

### Context

STD-04@1 §R10 says a gate whose tool is missing fails, and §R12 puts every
parity check CI runs into the fast local gate, except those that need a
build. `cargo-nextest` (per-test timeouts, `--no-tests=fail`) and
`cargo-deny` are not installed everywhere a copy of this template is built.

### Decision

Deviation from STD-04@1 §R10 for local runs only: without `cargo-deny` the
supply-chain check is skipped, and without `cargo-nextest` the tests run
under `cargo test`, each with a warning naming the install command. Under
`CI=true` (set by GitHub Actions) either missing tool fails the gate, and CI
installs both at pinned versions. `ci-fast` runs formatting, the structure
checks and `standards-check`. Two checks stay out of it under STD-04@1 §R12
because they need a build: the help and output goldens (`make goldens`) and
Cargo.lock freshness (`--locked` on every cargo build).

### Consequences

- A fresh clone passes `make ci` with only cargo installed, and CI cannot
  pass with a gate missing.
- Cost: a local green `make ci` without those tools is weaker than CI's.

## Template decisions not carried over

The template's note-store decisions (persistence module, one module per noun, audit guard, `--json` alias, list envelope, store lock, store format registry, owner-only store state, malformed-note handling, environment fallbacks) were removed with the note domain. They return, rewritten for the office domain, only when the feature they govern lands.
